A basic calculator GUI application built using Java Swing. The `CalculatorGUI` class extends `JFrame` and implements the `ActionListener` interface. 
It creates a graphical calculator interface with number buttons (0-9), operation buttons (+, -, *, /), an equals button (=), and a clear button (C). 
Users can click the number buttons to input digits, the operation buttons to select an arithmetic operation, and the equals button to perform calculations. 
The `actionPerformed` method handles button clicks, updating the input field and performing calculations based on the user's interactions. 
The GUI layout is organized using a `JPanel` with a grid layout, providing a user-friendly calculator interface.
